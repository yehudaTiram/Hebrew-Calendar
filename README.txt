This simple Wordpress ACF calendar plugin is based on Roee Yossef excellent article at
https://he.savvy.co.il/blog/%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A1/display-events-on-hebrew-calendar-wordpress/.
This plugin is merely porting the code from this article into a plugin. 
I may add some feature in the future.

You need to install ACF Pro in order to use it.
You need to import the file acf-export-2019-08-20.json (in the plugin root) into ACF to create the fields needed for the calendar.
